Problem solving is a process that uses steps to solve problems. Formulation the problem is really half the solution, the other half is what machine learning model can help. It is important to train yourself of how to formulate the right problem statement.
It is expected that we have 29.3 billion networked devices by 2023. Today, 1.85 million different apps are available for users to download. Android users have even more from which to choose, with 2.56 million available through the Google Play Store. These apps have come to play a huge role in the way we live our lives today.
Our world is full of innovative, forward-thinking, and savvy app developers. Every day, app creatives and programmers are out there not only solving problems with mobile apps and platforms but also identifying and anticipating problems that can be easily dealt with via an app at some point in the future. To train the problem solving skills is one of the major objectives for all the app developer interns.

#### Brainstorm by Yourself

Failure does build characteristics for us. Even the solution may not be the optimal one, the process stand and can be modified to do better next time.

As creative problem-solving skills for everyone are being learned, there will likely be moments where we are frustrated or unsure. Here are some easy ways to practice: Ask clarifying questions if you don’t understand something. Admit when don’t know the correct answer. Talk through multiple possible outcomes for different situation. Verbalize how you’re feeling when you find a problem.
