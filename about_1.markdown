## Leadership Team

Strong mind leaders never afraid of being threatened by smart competitors and tough customers, we like to be challenged. We’re lifelong learners who are invested in gaining more knowledge. Leaders don’t invest our energy into masking our vulnerabilities. Instead, we address our weaknesses head-on by building a high-performing diverse team. Leader’s job is distributing authority and responsibilities so as to maximize chances of success.

## Advisory Board

Advisory boards can be structured both to help with the direct operation of our company and to keep us informed on various business, legal and financial trends that may affect us and our business. Generally, we need a legal advisor, an accountant, a marketing expert, a human resources expert and definitely a financial advisor. We may also want successful entrepreneurs from other industries who understand the basics of business and will view our operation with a fresh eye.
